For the repositories in the vector store containing all source code files, analyze the following user request:

{}

Your objective is to critically evaluate each repository separately to determine which files will be affected by the above request. Based on your analysis, create a set of tickets/issues for each repository that outline distinct units of work. Each ticket should:

1. Specify whether it pertains to the repositories.
2. Describe the specific work to be done.
3. Detail the changes required.
4. List the relevant files that will be impacted.

Ensure that each ticket is clear and concise, providing enough information for a software engineer to understand and implement the necessary changes. Replace REQUEST with the actual user request or requirements string when you use this prompt.
